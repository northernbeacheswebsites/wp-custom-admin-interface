== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The custom admin menu has stuffed my site how can I get it back to normal =
We don't foresee such an event occuring but if you do happen to run into this you can visit: yourwebsite.com/index.php?wp-custom-admin-interface=delete-menu (replacing yourwebsite.com with your website) and this will delete all the options associated with the custom admin menu. You need to make sure you are still logged in to an admin account for this to work. If you don't have admin access you'll need to either remove the database option or delete the plugin entirely. 

= Is WP Custom Admin Interface completely free =
Yes! And there's no pro version. Woohoo!

= Need further help? =
Please use the support forum to raise any issues or questions.
