With WP Custom Admin Interface you can easily customise the WordPress admin and login interfaces. 

== Description ==

With this plugin you can easily customise the WordPress admin and login interfaces, create a coming soon/maintenance page and create a dashboard widget. I designed this plugin because I was tired of using several small plugins to do the same thing. While these small plugins worked ok, having a lot of the common functions in one plugin is a lot easier and because you can export and import the plugin settings with ease it makes it easy to deploy customisations across several websites which is something I do all the time. 

I don't proclaim this plugin to be an 'all-in-one' admin customiser solution unlike some other plugins. It just does what I consider to be the main things, but does it well. I do in the future plan on implementing a main admin menu customiser. At the moment you can:

* Change the login screen background color
* Change the login screen logo
* Add a custom favicon to the backend and frontend of your website
* Change the link and button colors
* Customise the footer text which appears on every admin page and use the shortcode [year] to show the current year (for use in copyright text).
* Remove the WordPress version number from the footer
* Remove the admin toolbar from displaying on the frontend of WordPress
* Add custom admin CSS
* Add custom Javascript/jQuery
* Add custom PHP to WordPress
* Create a coming soon/maintenance page with custom content
* Create a custom dashboard widget
* You can set a future date to expire the maintenance mode
* Export and import settings
